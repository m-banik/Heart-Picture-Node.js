# Heart drawing JavaScript programme- Node.js

## About

The code is made and tested with Node.js v11.12.0. It returns a heart picture made of dots and hashes in the console. The user may provide the picture parameters. They are in the following order:

- picture's width,
- it's first, higher, height,
- middle height,
- lower height.

The programme draws heart with parameters 1:1:1:1 by default(if the user didn't provide any). The user may provide only one, two or three parameters- it will work with the rest set as default. Also, any extra parameters will be ignored making no harm to the process- first four parameters will count. The programme is secured and will not accept parameters that are not integers.
